# Task:
Develop a program that inputs the number and dimensions of rectangles from the keyboard and outputs the areas and perimeters of the rectangles.
# Requirements for the program:
Create a file called Main.java
In the generated file, describe:
1) The abstract class Figure, which contains two abstract methods: getArea and getPerimeter, both methods return a double value, both methods have no parameters.
2) The Rectangle class, which is a descendant of the Figure class (methods getArea and getPerimeter must calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle). In addition, the Rectangle class must contain two double fields width and height and constructors to initialize the given fields.
3) The public class Main, which contains the main() method. In the change method, do the following:
- Create an array of elements of type Figure. The number of elements must be entered from the keyboard.
- Fill the created array with objects of the Rectangle class, the dimensions of the rectangles must be entered from the keyboard.
- With the getArea and getPerimeter methods, calculate the areas and perimeters of all rectangles and output them to the screen (the area must be separated from the perimeter with a space, information about each of the rectangles must be output on a new line, real numbers must be output with two decimal places).
# Special requirements for the program:
- Place a comment at the beginning of the program containing information about the developer of the program (student ID number, first name, last name, group number).
- Input errors are not allowed to be processed.
